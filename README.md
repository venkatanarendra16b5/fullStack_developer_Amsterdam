# Graph Hierarchy Visualization – Full Stack Assignment

This project visualizes hierarchical graph data using a 
- Node.js - backend 
- Vue 3 (Composition API) + D3.js - frontend.

The backend transforms flat graph data into a hierarchical structure, and the frontend renders it as an interactive horizontal tree with node details.

---

## ✨ Features

- Hierarchical tree visualization (left → right)
- Rectangular node cards for better readability
- Clickable nodes with detail panel
- Node deselection support
- Clean separation of backend and frontend
- Efficient tree construction (O(n))

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript

### Frontend
- Vue 3 (Composition API – CDN based)
- D3.js (Tree layout)
- HTML / CSS

## ▶️ How to Run the Application Locally

### 1️⃣ Run the Backend

- cd backend
- npm install
- npm start
- Backend runs at: http://localhost:3000
- API endpoint: GET /api/tree

### 2️⃣ Run the Frontend
- cd frontend
- npx serve .
- Then: Open the provided URL in the browser
- Note: The frontend is a static Vue 3 application and does not require a build step.

### 🖥️ How to Use the Application

- The tree hierarchy is displayed horizontally
- Click on any node to view its details (name & description)
- The selected node is highlighted
- Click the ❌ button in the details panel to deselect the node

### 📡 API Response Format
- json
- {
-  "success": true,
-  "data": [
-    {
-      "name": "A",
-      "description": "This is the description of A",
-      "children": []
-    }
-  ]
- }

### 🧠 Design Decisions
- =>Flat data structure is used as input for simplicity and scalability
- =>Tree is constructed using a Map to ensure O(n) time complexity
- =>D3.js handles SVG rendering and layout calculations
- =>Vue 3 manages application state and user interactions
- =>Backend and frontend are fully decoupled

### ⚡ Performance Considerations
- =>Tree construction runs in linear time
- =>Single API call for fetching data
- =>Stateless backend
- =>D3 optimizes DOM updates for complex visualizations

### 🚨 Edge Cases Handled
- =>Missing parent nodes are treated as root nodes
- =>Empty dataset returns an empty tree
- =>Duplicate node names handled safely
- =>Node deselection supported

### 🔮 Possible Improvements
- =>Persist data using a graph database (e.g., Neo4j)
- =>Add unit test coverage
- =>Support very large graphs using lazy loading
- =>Deploy backend and frontend to cloud infrastructure
